// If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is  identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.
// Scientists gave virus (V) of composition string (coronavirus). 
// We have to take N number of samples (example input is 4)
// The blood samples strings are subsequence or not, ("abcde" is subsequence to "coronavirus" or not). means this sample "abcde" is "NEGATIVE". 
// Constraints (edge case)
// 1<= N <=10
// 1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5
